### Development Process
[Game Requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12n01eAFY9EPrAL0Flh9hDlbNzlk1hWhrJ8MO6sOsLeY/edit?usp=sharing "Game Requirements")

The game requirements were used to plan the flow of the application. I created the initial wireframe and used it to formulate user stories. The requirements and user stories allowed me to detail execution steps for the application and with these I was able to categorize the application's functionality steps into JavaScript variables, functions, conditionals and API calls. Since syling beyond a game board was not a requirement it was completed last. I considered what imagery the game title could represent.


### Problem Solving Strategies
Since I highlighted the application's functionality steps into different categories, problem solving was a step by step process that used this pre-planning as a base. I handwrote potential code for problem solving and adjusted as I built the application. After receiving intial feedback I created a new wireframe to guide the UI functionality and continued to problem solve using game requirements and formulated planning sheets. Application was successfully built with no user-facing bugs or inactive controls.


### Unsolved Problems
In future iterations I would like to create an API for the game to improve the user's experience, allowing the user to personalize their game play experience. I would also like to add the option to play against a computer with varying levels of difficulty. In future iterations I would like to update the styling of the game to include animations.
